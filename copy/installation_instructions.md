Follow this easy sign-up process to access all of the benefits of the free-tier, including process management, internal knowledge base, process analytics, and agent scripting:

- Install the "BrightReps Sidekick" app from the Zendesk app marketplace
- Open a ticket and Sidekick will launch on the right sidebar.
- Sign in with Zendesk. If you are the first user for your company you will be prompted to enter your Company Name and click Sign Up. You will automatically be assigned an Admin role.
