Whether it's returns / RMAs, order status inquiries, troubleshooting, or onboarding / offboarding BrightReps Sidekick enables you to automate your team's most painful workflows and consolidate them down to a single interface using a knowledgebase of step by step instructions, decision trees, a customer 360, actionable context, and powerful integrations.

Follow this easy sign-up process to access all of the benefits of the free-tier, including process management, internal knowledge base, process analytics, and agent scripting:

- Install the "BrightReps Sidekick" app from the Zendesk app marketplace
- Open a ticket and Sidekick will launch on the right sidebar.
- Sign in with Zendesk. If you are the first user for your company you will be prompted to enter your Company Name and click Sign Up. You will automatically be assigned an Admin role.
