To install BrightReps Knowledge:

1. Install the app from the Zendesk marketplace.
2. Open the app from either the ticket sidebar, new ticket sidebar, or ticket editor.
3. The app will say “Welcome to BrightReps Knowledge!” and below that there will be a button that says “Sign In With Zendesk”. Click the button.
4. A new browser tab will be opened that will request permission to link your Zendesk account to BrightReps. This will allow you to log in to BrightReps with your Zendesk account.
5. Next, if you are the first person in your Zendesk organization to create a BrightReps account, you will be prompted to create the company account by entering your company details. Note: you will be the admin on the account. Any additional members of your organization who log in with BrightReps will automatically get added to the account.
6. Once that is complete, you can close the browser tab and return to Zendesk and you should be logged in to BrightReps Knowledge.
