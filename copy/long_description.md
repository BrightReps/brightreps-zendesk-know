BrightReps Sidekickâ„¢ enables customer support teams to build, use, and measure their process flows in a streamlined way.

- Flow Builder - From the Admin Portal managers can build, download, and publish their process flows for reps to follow right from the Zendesk ticket.

- Integrated Workflows - From the Sidekick app on Zendesk reps receive step by step instructions, including integrated step types to streamline their work and eliminate the need to swivel chair between multiple systems and reference static process flow documents. Integrated steps are only available on the Paid Plan ($20 per user per month; includes a 30 day free trial).

- Process Analytics - As reps work from Sidekick, managers are able to view process analytics from the Admin Portal including heat maps of step completions, time taken by step, and rep feedback to continuously measure and improve their processes.
